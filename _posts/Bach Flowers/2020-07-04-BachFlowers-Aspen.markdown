## Aspen

### The Aspen fear may be no more than a sense of foreboding, an uneasy anxiety that
something unpleasant or frightening is going to happen. At the other it can be a real
terror, with physical symptoms such as the hair standing on end.
Sometimes people think of Aspen as a night‐time fear, related to dreams and night
terrors. Aspen would certainly be the right remedy if you were lying awake in the
dark scared of something but not knowing what it was. But in fact Dr Bach said that
fear of the dark is a Mimulus fear, since the cause (the dark) can be named. And
nameless Aspen fears are just as likely to occur in full sunlight as on a dark night.

## Dr Bach's description

### Vague unknown fears, for which there can be given no explanation, no reason. Yet the patient may be terrified of something terrible going to happen, he knows not what. These vague unexplainable fears may haunt by night or day. Sufferers often are afraid to tell their trouble to others.
