<h2> What is the CBD Entourage Effect?</h2>

<h4> When you’re comparing a medicine’s pure synthetic form to the same substance in its natural form, particularly plants, a large part of alternative medicine is based on using the entire plant for medicinal purposes rather than isolating or producing the active ingredient in a laboratory. It’s called whole plant medicine, and herbalists excel at matching holistic, plant-based treatments to a variety of ailments. In a world inundated with Western medicine, pills, and quick fixes, this approach may seem old-fashioned, but mounting evidence suggests that medical substances may be more effective in plant form than in pill form.</h4>

<h4> This phenomenon, called the “entourage effect,” results when hundreds of natural components within a plant interact together and with the human body to produce a stronger influence than any one of those components used alone. It’s a synergistic effect. When we combine multiple compounds in their natural state, we don’t end up with the sum of the parts; we get a multiplying effect instead. The different compounds can amplify each other’s effects, making the overall plant more effective in treating the unwanted medical symptoms.</h4>

    THE ENTOURAGE EFFECT CREATES SYNERGISTIC BENEFITS BETWEEN CANNABINOIDS AND TERPENES
    IN HEMP OIL PRODUCTS.

<h3> CAN CBD HEMP OIL PROVIDE THE ENTOURAGE EFFECT?</h3>

<h4> Yes! Just like oil extracted from the marijuana plant, oil extracted from hemp also contains many cannabinoids, flavonoids, and terpenes, as well as essential vitamins and minerals, fatty acids, fiber, protein, and chlorophyll. All these components, when taken as a complete product, make hemp oil a complete supplement and encourage the entourage effect.</h4>

<h4> While there are trace amounts of a number of cannabinoids in hemp, the primary compounds are cannabidiolic acid (CBDa) and cannabidiol (CBD). CBDa is more abundant in live hemp than CBD, and to get high levels of CBD in hemp oil products, raw hemp oil must be decarboxylated in a process that heats the oil, changing CBDa into CBD. Both CBDa and CBD have been shown to possess a range of benefits through its interaction with the body’s native endocannabinoid system. CBD, CBDa, and the rest of the cannabinoids present in hemp work in tandem when absorbed into the bloodstream. </h4>

<h4> Additionally, extracted hemp oil contains an extensive list of naturally occurring vitamins, including vitamins A, C, and E. Also present are B complex vitamins like riboflavin, thiamine, and niacin. Hemp further contains vitamins that are not sufficiently present in most modern diets, like beta carotene, helping users gain the nutrients they need to maintain health. Hemp oil is likewise a source of minerals like zinc, potassium, calcium, phosphorous, iron, and magnesium.</h4>

<h4> Protein in your diet is essential in the receiving of amino acids, but it’s important that we obtain protein from the right sources. Eating even small amounts of red meat has been warned against by health officials. Instead, essential amino acids can be obtained through sources like hemp, which contains all 20 amino acids – including the 9 essential amino acids our body can’t make on its own.</h4>

<h4> The one fat you can never get enough of is Omega 3, but modern diets typically use other, less healthy fats. While both Omega 3 and 6 fatty acids are essential to human health, they should ideally be consumed at a close ratio of around 3:1. Eating the right kind of Omega 6 fatty acids, like gamma linolenic acid (GLA), a plant based Omega 6 fatty acid found in hemp at the 3:1 ratio suggested, can reduce the negative effects of high fat diets.</h4>

<h4> The cannabinoids in hemp oil work together in the entourage effect to provide their balancing effects, while the many nutrients present supplement our deficient modern diets. Contemporary fast food diets high in unhealthy fats largely fail in supplying the vitamins and minerals our bodies need each day, making dietary supplements with these nutrients critical in maintaining a healthy balance. Hemp oil contains a complex mix of cannabinoids, essential nutrients, healthy fats, protein, and fiber, making it a unique choice in daily use supplements.</h4>

<h4> When viewed as a complete dietary supplement, we begin to see the value of CBD hemp oil beyond being a source of CBD. The bioactive compounds found in hemp oil work together to provide health and wellness benefits and to stimulate the endocannabinoid system.</h4>
