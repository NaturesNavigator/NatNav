#### Reams Biological Theory of Ionization represents a mathematical expression that reflects the way the person's body is managing energy and suggests what raw materials (nutrients - minerals, vitamins, etc.) are deficient. 

#### This set of numbers reflects three glaringly obvious things: 
	1) Dehydration 
    2) CalciumS deficiency - imbalanced liver
    3) and Vitamin C deficiency. 

#### Those three contribute to a lack of oxygen throughout the body and due to the cationic pH, the energy is pulling to locations below the waist, thereby depriving organs above the waist of oxygen, thus you have a physical cause/effect for lack of oxygen to the brain which would provide a root cause for "learning challenges". 

#### Regarding the prediction of a very specific "main learning challenge": THAT IS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF RBTI. 
#### The numbers suggest this child may be very restless, fidgety, display nervousness behavior, anxiety, fear, and even co-dependent behavior - NOT all of these symptoms and behaviors are necessarily present but simply suggests what COULD be observed by others. 

#### Three PHYSICAL things you could provide this child in order to cause a positive change in her body chemistry are: 

	1) DISTILLED Water 
	2) Onion Soup
    3) Cal II, Cal Gluconate, Min-Col and Algazim. 

#### I would also suggest you look at her emotional foundations and support with Bach or other flower remedies, emotion/body code or other related approach, and an abundance of ACTIVE LISTENING on your part. 

#### P.S. - I would also review eating habits, food choices, vaccine injury possibility, past surgeries and pharmaceutical usage and environmental living conditions the child has been subjected to in the first 12 years of her life.


##### Vitamin C, the FURTHER the numbers are away from perfect, the more Vitamin C deficient that person is because Vitamin C is "the glue" that holds the cells together and when there is energy loss, there is Vitamin C loss. 

##### Whenever one bathes, there is a loss of Vitamin C too and that is a prime reason it is recommended to apply skin protectant of some type after bathing to close the open pores and stop the loss of Vitamin C due to that. 

##### Now, it is said that the more cationic the energy the less Vitamin C is absorbed - so what? Some is better than none. For cationic energy environments, 

##### Dr. Reams found onion soup to be the best source of Vitamin C because that has a neutral (meaning it does not change) effect on pH. 

##### You can remember cations/cationic energy if you picture a cat in your mind and remember that a cat typically lands with its paws on the ground. 

##### Therefore, the prime source of cationic energy is Mother Earth, herself. This is why many that put their hands in the soil on a daily basis tend to be healthier as they are absorbing the "positive" cations to balance the "negative" anions they are breathing from the Van Allen Belt (the sky or atmosphere, if you prefer). 

##### So, cationic energy flows towards Mother Earth and anionic energy flows towards the sky (Van Allen Belt). In the case of this set of numbers, the pHs are both CATIONIC and the average pH is also cationic (5.5 plus 6.2 plus 6.2 = 17.9. 17.9 divided by 3 = 5.97). 

##### Average pH tells us how the energy is trending or moving throughout the body.  It is moving downward and where it moves away from there will be an even greater lack of nutrients and oxygen is one such nutrient. With those data points, it is easy to see the picture and connect the dots. :-)

##### The series continues :-) Yes, once all the rules have been posted that I'm referencing from the Owens Transcript, I will be circling back to connect the dots.

##### **Rule:** There are two extremes that bring about resistance, 0 and 14 and somewhere between 0 and 14 is your line and measure of resistance. 7 is said to be neutral.

##### Here's the next rule from the Owens Transcript concerning pH and Resistance:

##### **Rule:** The urine specimen is only good for about an hour. After an hour the tests lose their real meaning because the bacteria in the specimen change it.

##### **Rule:** Calcium is needed more by weight and volume than any other mineral.
