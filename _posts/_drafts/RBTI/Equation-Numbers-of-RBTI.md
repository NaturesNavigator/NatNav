####  People always ask upon a first RBTI meeting "What's wrong with me". Dr Reams points out that this is where Reams testers are potentially accusesd (falsely) of practicing medicine without a license.

#### RBTI demonstrates where you are in relationship to the biological scale of perfect health.  

#### To begin, let's examine the mind and it's related divisions.  We are of two minds:  
#### The Conscious mind  which we think, learn, are taught principles of life, professional and non-professional duties.
#### The Subconscious mind which is the spirit mind. Spirit mind controls and maintains life. It is that involuntary part of the brain that keeps our organs fuminct hout requiring any thought on our behalf.
#### The bible says that upon death, spirit returns to God who made it.  The soul, on the otherhand, goes down to the grave returning to the dust from which it came.
#### So the soul, which comes from dust, contains frequencies, and what is found in RBTI numbers and referenced as micronage, milli-micronage and the millimilli-micronage.

#### Dr Reams once told an undertaker that took the RBTI training that:

    "It's my job to keep people out of your office and place of business as long as I can": That I am here because I want them to stay out and live to a ripe old age."

#### The undertaker added:

	"I was looking at bodies of adults in the morgue 
    one day and thought " they wanted to be ... a freedom
    of choice ... they broke every rule of health. 
    They abused their bodies. They went to physicians 
    instead of going to God for healing. They took drugs instead 
    of minerals to get well.  They did not seek to clean
    the temple of God.  What other conclusion could there be?"


#### While in the South Pacific during the war one of the things that Dr Reams learned was that natives there never grow old.  They all die young due to their standard of living being so low, their food is so poor and the quality of their life is thinking there is nothing really to live for.  He saw natives 30 years old that look like 70 or 80 years old..  

#### This is what happens when wrong foods are used. It releases too many calories of heat energy or electrical energy at the wrong time and the body cannot assimilate it.
### This will show up in the numbers!

#### Disease will set in at the weakest place first, so the numbers in the test then come forth and enable us to zero in on the organ, or organs, that are affected.
### Excessive heat energy will burn out the weakest place first
 
#### The RBTI numbers in the test then come forth and zero in on the organ, or organs, that are affected.
#### All diseases start with one or more of the vital organs controlled by the central nervous system, chiefly the "Liver", but then spreads to other organs.  This spreading occurs because the liver manufactures the skeleton of the amino acid for all other organs, and the amino acid is the building block that we live on.

### Mineral deficiency is the cause of all diseases!

#### Higher specific gravity the less energy we get from the foods we eat.  The lower the specific gravity, below the range A,  the faster the food passes through the system and it does not have the time to toake the energy properly from the food.  The numbers show what organs are losing the energy.

	Liver => Amino Acids > Building blocks =  for all organs!


#### Collagen disease is old-fashion scurvy due to lack of vitamin C, and affects the entire body chemistry.  Cells start coming apart, and energy is lost throughout the system. This is the beginning of this disease is the lack of calciums
	Lack of calciums => decrease Vitamin C = weakening tissue, gastric juices
	Collagen disease => is old-fashion scurvy => due to lack of vitamin C => affects entire chemistry,!

#### Collagen disease begins with the lack of calciums causing the decrease in Vitamin C resulting in weakening of tissues and gastric juices affecting RBTI numbers
#### RBTI indicates the "State of Health" inclusive of the amount of reserve energy of the individual.

    Higher reserves => greater liberty to break the rules! 
    Lower  reserves => lesser  liberty to break the rules!

#### People who are very ill, with a reserve rating below 15, their gastric juices are as diluted as an infant and so should live on baby food until energy is restored or inceases.
#### Body chemistry and lack of response to diet can be from two reasons.  The first is a brain tumer in the left quadrant of the brain.  The second is unrepairabledamage to the main vagus nerve which carries the message from the brain to the vital organs and which supplies the total daily nutrient (TDN) needed to maintain the maximum amount of reserver energy.  

#### Example:
    
    CS  7.0| 7.70/7.80 | 45C | 4M | 14/15 
    Range C | male |age 25 | 6'0" |180 lbs.

    Status: 
      critical condition in that the  body chemistry is in range C
	Carbohydrates indicate: 
      borderline diabetic | Energy will drop down if pancrease
    produces too much insulin | insignificant insulin means cannot assimilate 
    Vitamin C.
