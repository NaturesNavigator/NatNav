#### The theory of ionization began long before this dispensation. It began with God. Someone asked the question:  did God come from?" You will find that answer in the Book of Revelation:	

	"Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep
    those things that are written therein: for the time is at hand" (1:3).
    
#### Then it goes on to tell what John saw and answers the question: 

	"I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last." 

#### Another translation says that 

	God "has always been and always will be." 
    
#### In the first chapter of the Book of Genesis we find God the creator and maker. After He made man He said, 

	" ... Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth." 

#### You cannot replenish something unless it had been inhabited before. Any geologist will tell you that there were at one time volcanos, volcanic ash, etc. So, God being a flaming fire, or flaming torch, evidently created things that were quite hot in the beginning, and therefore the heat in itself brought into being the process of ionization, of putting things together and taking them apart. 

#### If you read farther in the Bible you will find that Lucifer, the archangel of all angels, made war in heaven and one-third of the angels made war with the other angels and God cast Lucifer down to the planet earth. And then, apparently Satan put his plan into existence and the waters became mixed with the dry land, and the sun refused to shine. 

#### Satan didn't pay his gas bill, or something of the kind because if the sun wasn't shining and the ionization of the spheres were not taking place, the earth would stand still. 

#### The ionization of the spheres is the energy that God makes to hold the stars in place. The stars are suns, and around the stars the planets and moons rotate. Some planets have more than one moon, but all only have one sun. The closer you get to the sun the faster the planets rotate. The further away from the sun, the longer it takes for them to rotate. For instance, one of our years equals about three of Venus' years, and with Saturn it would take approximately 12 of our years to be one of its years. So the closer the sun is to the planet the faster the planets rotate-it is the increase of energy which is an increase of speed (the same as in an automobile, or anything that moves). 

	The greater the amount of energy, the faster the plant grows. 

#### Animals are not controlled by this same energy because they have glands. Then we can conclude that anything that doesn't have glands, like a plant, the process of osmosis is not limited by time, but animals that have glands are limited by time. 

#### A plant within a few weeks or months from the time it is seeded can reproduce itself, but people have to be in their teens before they are able to reproduce. Animals and birds have to be in different ages to reproduce. This is what we mean by the ionization of the spheres-the energy that makes anything dick, or the energy that keeps it going. 

#### God in His great wisdom and mercy planned (Genesis 1) a new way to reestablish or replenish the earth.  In Genesis 1:1 you will find these words: 

		"In the beginning God." 

#### He always has been and always will be. He created. This is God the Father who then formed the blueprint for this dispensation in which we find ourselves. The first thing He made was LIGHT. And the sun began to shine again, and the earth began to rotate. The subterfuge of the earth turning caused the waters to separate from the dry land. 

#### Some people question whether or not God did this in a minute, or whether He took a thousand, or thousands of years to do it. As these first events were taking place there was no time. There was a rhythm but there was no time. Therefore, if there is no time, everything that was done had to be done instantaneously, and God spoke and it was so. 

#### Whenever you begin to deal with ionization you are no longer dealing with geometrical math but relative math. In relative math everything comes back to its starting point. A wheel turns. The earth rotates. Columbus proved that the earth was round. These are facts that are relevant. 

#### In the field of geometric science there are straight lines and angles. In relative math there are no straight lines and no angles. For example: In geometric math the nearest distance between two points is a straight line. But in relative math this is not true, it is not the nearest distance. 

#### If we wanted to go straight from a certain place in the USA to Moscow, Russia, we would have to go straight through the earth for that is the nearest line, or the shortest distance. However, you can't get there that way so you have to go around the earth. This is not taking a straight line but an arc. That is relative math.

#### Another example of relative math is putting man on the moon. Man went from the USA to the moon, and in order to get back to the earth man did not turn around and come back to the earth, he continued in the same direction so that he could catch the earth in its orbit from the opposite side of the moon. 

#### The mysteries of God are so great and so magnificent that it is very difficult for a human mind to conceive of the greatness of God. In the first and second chapters of the Book of Genesis is given the blueprint of this dispensation and the formation of our solar system. In the Gospel of St. John these words verify these facts: "The Word was made flesh." (This is speaking of Jesus Christ, the Messiah.) "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." 

#### The word GOD means Father, Son and the Holy Spirit. It is the name of the deity. But there is a difference in God the Father, God the Son and God the Holy Spirit. There are denominations that teach that there is only one God. We agree. However, we agree it is God in three persons. 

#### "The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him." This speaks of the Son, for it says, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made. In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not" (John 1:25). There was darkness upon the face of the deep, and the sun began to shine. There was a shadow, and there was light. But where Christ is there is no shadow. 

		"There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. 

#### The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light, that all men through him might believe. He was not that light" (John the Baptist was not that light) "but was sent to bear witness of that Light. That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. He was in the world," (this means Jesus, the Messiah) "and the world was made by him." This bears out the fact given in the second chapter of Genesis-the world was made by Him, and the world knew Him not. "He came unto his own, and his own received him not." This pinpoints for us that the Son of God, the Messiah, created or made everything for which the Father had made a blueprint. 

#### How did He do it? 
#### Fifty years ago we thought that nothing was smaller than an atom. Later we were to find that every atom was a little galaxy within itself. 

#### To give an idea of how small an atom is: There are approximately 15 million atoms in one drop of water. An atom is a very, very small element, and is thought of as being mostly in elementary form. Once you leave an element then you have a compound which is composed of two or more elements, but a single atom must be in elementary form.

#### There are only 120 elements, and man has discovered approximately 110 of them. Some of the elements in their pure state would be: aluminum, carbon, gold, helium, hydrogen, iron, lithium, manganese, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus, potash, potassium, silver. It would take a book to explain the ionization, or the way one of these elements came into existence. 

#### If the atom isn't the smallest element, what then is the smallest element that God created? The answer is: ION. We say ION but actually an ION can be either an ANION or a CATION (pronounced, cat-eyeon). There is nothing smaller that God the Messiah created. After you leave that there is absolute nothingness. 

#### What is a single anion? It is the smallest amount of energy in existence. The discoverer of this was Mr. Milhouse, and he called it a "Milhouse unit of energy." This term is no longer in use. It was a very common term fifty years ago. It means a millionth of a millionth of a millionth of a particle of energy, until there is no more. There is nothing else to divide. 

#### The next smallest substance that God created was the CATION. The smallest cation contains 500% more energy than a single ANION. All anions were not singles but are combinations of anions. Therefore we must conclude that a single anion has a Milhouse unit of energy of from one Milhouse unit to a maximum of 499 Milhouse units of energy. If this then is the limit of the power of an anion, then a cation must also have its limits. 

#### The limits of a cation is from 500 Milhouse units of energy to 999 Milhouse units of energy. If it took on one more Milhouse units of energy it would split into two and become two cations, or 500 Milhouse units each. We are now peeping into the mysteries of the creation of this entire universe. It was once said that "He who controls the atom can control the universe." That is true, but it is more accurate to say, HE WHO CONTROLS THE ANION AND THE CATION IS THE FOUNDER AND MAKER OF THE UNIVERSE. 

#### Anions and cations form the elements into nine geometrical energy patterns. It is a mystery to us today how there are 120 elements and all of these elements and compounds are made with only nine different patterns of energy. In any element you can have a variable number of anions and a variable number of cations within the same element to make it form into one of these nine patterns, but the energy is a synchronized energy which equals the specific gravity.

#### When most people think of energy they only think of heat energy. But heat is only one kind of energy. When we think of heat we must think of patterns of energy. Think of two kinds of patterns: anionic and cationic patterns. The cationic heat has various shapes, and the anionic heat energy has but one shape

#### This is another mystery of God. All anionic energy is shaped exactly alike whether it is one Milhouse unit of energy or 499 units of energy. Cations have nine patterns of energy. 

#### The interior of an atom is called nucleus, and the outer is called the shell. The entire nucleus of an atom we will call an ION, and it may be a cation or an anion, but never mixed. An electron may be a cation or an anion, but an ion is always the interior of the shell. and the electron is always the outer shell itself. This is the path that the electrons travel that form the nine patterns of energy. 

#### When you stand in front of a heater, you are being bombarded with anions and cations of energy. They are so small, the anions can penetrate right through you without even touching you. It is like looking inside a box of grapefruit. You can drop marbles down between the grapefruit to the bottom of the box without even touching the grapefruit. 

#### There are three kinds of energy. 

		Heat energy (E1= MC2). In this book E1 is heat energy. 
		Electrical energy (E2 = E1 + MC2), which we will call electrical 		energy. 
		Matter (M = E1 + E2C2). 

#### This too is energy which is solidified, as is found in rock, any vegetable or fruit. The greater the density, the harder and the heavier the weight of any matter whether biological or not. 

#### This then lets us peek into the mysteries of the creation of this universe. It is called the process of ionization. 

#### The process of ionization is LIKE THINGS ATTRACTING EACH OTHER. Nature follows a line of least resistance, and as it follows the line of least resistance like things attract each other. We have a proverb: "Birds of a feather flock together." So it is with the elements. Like elements attract each other. That is why gold is found in veins. Precious metals are found in deposits because these deposits attract from the entire earth the things that are like them. 

#### Nearly 100 miles above the earth is the Van Allen (radiation) belt. This belt is the shell that completely surrounds this earth, and if it were not for that shell around this earth this planet wouldn't turn because the radiation of the sun strikes the Van Allen belt and creates a static field between the Van Allen belt which is anionic and the earth which is cationic and causes the earth to rotate, or any other planet to rotate. The moon doesn't rotate because it has no radiation belt. This is the law of physics that God has made. The same law which causes this earth to turn, causes an electric motor to run, or causes an engine to turn a dynamo to make or convert metallic energy into electrical energy. The same principle, only it is one principle in reverse of  another principle. 

#### Most people were taught the principles of chemistry which are not correct, and this is why so many answers are not found. They were taught incorrectly the basic rules by which God made this universe. For example, in the chemistry books we were taught that an atom has to have the same number of protons as neutrons, or, the same number of anions as cations. This is not true. If it were true then all iron would be exactly alike. All fruit would be exactly alike. There would be only one kind of grass. There would be only one variety of trees, and all human beings would look exactly alike. The truth is that all atoms under the same temperature and pressure are the same size but they do not weigh the same. (I realize that this statement will create much controversy and some will label this author a quack, but as they begin to prove these statements they will find that these statements are true.) 

#### We have said that like things attract each other, and nature follows the line of least resistance. Since nature follows the line of least resistance then any atom with the same number of protons' and neutrons or anion and cations, would be a hydrogen atom, with the ratio of one to one. Already we have conflict with the logic of God with what is taught in the chemistry books. We have two statements that are just the opposite. 

#### This process can be more easily understood in considering compounds, such as H2O. H2O means 2 atoms of hydrogen and 1 atom of oxygen combined to form one molecule of water. 

	H has 1 anion and 1 cation 
	O has 1 anion and 16 cations 

#### If anions can be from 1 to 499, and we choose to assign the smallest amount of power (i.e. 1 Milhouse unit of energy) for the anions; and if the cations can be 500 to 599 Milhouse units of energy and we choose to assign the smallest amount of power (i.e. 500 Milhouse units) for the cations, the total amount of energy is just 1 molecule of very dry, light water =9003 Milhouse units of energy: 

    Anions  Cations   
    H = 1 +  500 =     501   
    H = 1 +  500 =     501   
    O = 1 + 16x500 =  8001            
             	  9003 water (H2O) 

#### H2O is two parts of hydrogen and one part of oxygen. Hydrogen has one anion and one cation in its joining to another molecule of two of the hydrogen atoms-which would be two anions and two cations as joining to another molecule of oxygen that does not have 8 electrons (or anions) and 8 protons (or cations), but does have one anion and 16 cations as oxygen. So we have water: H2O. There is no way that energy can be calculated or figured by mathematics with the old theory of equal number of anions and cations in an element, unless you figure the cationic energy versus the anionic resistance. There is no way to figure energy, because the total number of Milhouse units determines the total amount of energy. It is not possible for anything to give up this total amount of energy instantaneously without creating an explosion. 

#### In other words, the anions and cations would fly apart like a covey of quails that all flew away at once. In the natural decay anions are given up rather slowly, and the cations are given up very slowly. 

#### This isn't the realization of how things are put together, but how things are taken apart. This is done by noting the structure of the number of anions and cations that make up the compound, element, or metal. For instance, there are many different kinds of pure iron because of the different number of cations and anions that compose the pure iron. 

#### There are many different kinds of water, which is a compound, whereas iron is an element. There is heavy water. There is light water. There is just ordinary water, and then there is dry water. The less the number of Milhouse units in the water (I'm not speaking of impurities in the water), the lighter the water.

#### The greater the number of anion units in the Milhouse units in the nuclear atom and the higher the Milhouse units in the cation or electron in both the hydrogen and oxygen, the heavier the water. The greater the gravity, hence the difference in pure water. In this calculation of energy, we use 250 Milhouse units of anionic energy and 750 Milhouse units for cationic energy averages in working out the components of energy in the component total amount of energy in any given substance. So, then we have now found our basic foundation for organic and inorganic chemistry: 

	ORGANIC chemistry is any substance containing carbon. 
	INORGANIC chemistry is any substance not containing carbon. 

#### Another field of chemistry that is seldom mentioned, is the field of COLLOIDAL chemistry. There are two meanings or definitions of colloids. One is a measurement of size-ohms. In this field you may have colloidal elements like colloidal gold, colloidal Iron, colloidal silver, etc., which is strictly measure-mental size, only very, very small particles (like dust or fuller earth). In the other field the colloids are compounds.'

#### In the field of colloidal compounds each atom is a complete little solar system within itself. It has its sun and its moons and planets rotating around it. There are many different numbers of moons and stars rotating around the ION CORE of a colloidal compound molecule. This is very important in the formation of matter. 
#### Colloids are small, very much like the atoms except a colloid is the smallest amount of an element that can exist and the colloidal part of that matter is the smallest amount of- matter that can exist in either elementary or compound form. The compound colloids are so fine until one cubic inch of it would cover 7½ acres with a solid sheet of colloids. They are also a very fine, sticky, glue-like substance when they come in contact with moisture. But where there is no moisture, colloids will stand in the air as in a vacuum because they are so small until even gravity does not attract them, until they collect enough moisture to weight them down to the earth. Did you ever notice a beam of sunlight shining down through a dark room, and the solid particles (very fine round particles) floating through the air? Those are a group of colloids because you cannot see one single colloid. 
 
#### Colloids are very important in nature. The colloid in a tree makes it possible for that tree to stand erect, to go upward or perpendicular to the earth. But a vine does not have enough colloids in it for it to stand up, so it has to find something to climb on, and it climbs on something that has enough colloids to hold itself up. 

#### Without colloids we wouldn't have any fingernails toenails, hair, bones, or any substance to our system. Our bones and our teeth contain more colloids than any other part of our body because they are harder. Our fingernails and toenails contain the second greatest, hardest amount of colloids. 

#### Did you ever walk out in the morning and see the "diamond" in the dew drops? This "diamond" was a carbon colloid. 

#### Without colloids there would be no life upon this earth. 

#### We have mentioned that above the earth is the Van Allen belt, and in order to understand why trees grow perpendicular to the earth (and not lying on the ground like a vine), we must understand that the earth is cationic and the anions that are given off from the cationic structure of the wood or bark of the tree is greater than the cations which attract it to the earth, or hold it in the earth, and this causes the tree to reach outward toward the Van Allen belt. 

#### In a man's brain there is more potassium than there is in the feet. Potassium is an anionic element and therefore the brain is in the head, and we walk on our feet instead of our head. If our feet contained more potassium than our head then we would walk on our head with our feet in the air. 

#### Animals have a greater cationic structure in their system than anionic and therefore they walk on all four. The animal that has to depend on smell more than eyesight has to turn his nose nearest the earth because his sensation of smell leads him to the environment that he desires. When he is erect he holds high his head to see and smell better. 

#### Soft iron contains a very high carbon content. By heating the iron and cooling it, it becomes harder as the carbon content decreases. This is taking the carbons out of iron and the iron becomes more pure. But the impurity of iron softens it. Practically in all substances-the more impurities that are in that substance generally the softer it becomes. I'm speaking of most of the carbons. 

#### The more carbon that is in the substance the softer the substance becomes, with the exception of the diamond. However, this is only true in organic chemistry, and may be true in some cases of inorganic chemistry. 

#### All animal matter and plant matter contains carbon, and therefore is organic. It does not necessarily have to be decaying leaves or manure. 

#### Many people think that organic means that it comes from plant or animal matter. As far as the chemistry books, and as far as labels on goods in the store being organic or inorganic it means that it has carbon in it. Honey has carbon and therefor; is organic. One time I saw in a health food store a sign: "Organic Honey." I told the clerk I didn't care for the "organic" honey, and ordered five pounds of inorganic honey. 

#### "Sir," she said, "I don't think the owner will buy that kind, we only sell pure products!" You cannot have sugars without carbons, it is impossible (C6H22O11 is one carbohydrate). The C stands for carbon, and you cannot have a carbohydrate without carbon. I was telling my wife about this and she said, "I'll be your inorganic honey!"
