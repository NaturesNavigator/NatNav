### pH shows the measure of resistance in soils. 

##### The calciums that are needed to maintain our perfect health in life goes back to the responsibility of the farmer, and he hasn't been taught anything but to put lime on the ground, because there's no money in lime, it's only about 8 dollars a ton delivered, and many times they'll apply it on your farm for that much.

##### The experiment station tells you that if you have a low pH you need calcium in your soil and if you have a high pH you don't need calcium in your soil, and that's __the biggest lie__ that was ever told.

##### For instance, pure water with a pH of 7.0 has no acid, no alkaline and no calcium in it. Pure white builder's sand has a pH of 7.0 and also has no acid, no alkaline and no calcium in it. You get the idea, so how can they tell the public that a pH reading will denote whether you need calcium or don't need calcium. The experiment station staff are a bunch of idiots and the farmer's gullible enough to believe it, and cry all the way to the bank, broke! Broke, because pH is a measure of resistance and not a measure of volume.

#####  There's plenty of times that soils can have a pH of 8.0 and be deficient in calciums. Following is the ratio in tonnage for agricultural purposes and you can figure it out about the same ratio for people. If you had 2000 kg of pure white builder's sand and you add 50 kg of lime, mix it absolutely equal throughout you'd have 2050 kg by weight. If you then added 1 kg of flowers of sulfur and mix it absolutely equal you'd still have a pH of 7.

#####  Now suppose that in one hectare you had 50 kg of calcium and 1 kg of sulfur and it had a pH of 7. In another hectare you added 100 times the amount and had 5000 kg of calcium and 100 kg of sulfur you'd still have a pH of 7.

##### Now which would make the best crop, the one with 50 kg of calcium per hectare, or the one with 5000 kg of calcium per hectare considering that plants have more calcium in them than any other one element?

##### When you consider the value of a chart showing the pH on various foods you'll come to realize it's worthless because you'll not know the actual pH of a food you're eating, whether it's a 4 or 14, and that's the reason the chart is worthless. Now, if every peach had exactly the same pH range, or every orange had the exact same one, then it would be easy, but they don't. For instance, you have Valencia oranges that are so acid till you can't eat them, and others that are so sweet until they taste like honey. For instance, I've seen the same variety of peach with:

##### 1. a 10 brix sugar that were sweet and delicious, because it had a number 4 acid, but 
##### 2. a 16 brix sugar AND a 14 acid and they were so sour you couldn't eat them.

##### and that's the reason I said the chart was worthless.‚Äù

###### **Note:** This is not a discussion of how to grow high-brix crops, rather, what results from common agricultural practices.
