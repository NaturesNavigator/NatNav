#### Doc Reams taught RBTI as a series of 9 sessions. Sessions 1-5 were attended by many in the 1970s and I happen to have a copy of Paul Braddock's handwritten notes he gave me this summer. Also, I have a copy of Rob Owen's transcript of his notes from the first 5 sessions too. There are 10 rules mentioned that apply to pH and Resistance. I'll attempt to share one a day for the next 10 days beginning with this one:

#### **RULE:**  No number is "perfect" unless all numbers are "perfect". "Perfect" pH is 6.40 over 6.40, when, and only when, ALL numbers are perfect.

#### **Rule:** The greater the specific gravity of a mineral the less likely the body is to take it the more dilute the gastric juices become. In other words, the more dilute the gastric juices the less mineral anyone can get out of their food, and the less mineral they get out of their food the less energy they get on the frequency that they need and consequently the very energy that they need is passing out of their system undigested.


#### **Rule:**  There are two extremes that bring about resistance, 0 and 14 and somewhere between 0 and 14 is your line and measure of resistance. 7 is said to be neutral.

#### Here's the next rule from the __Owens Transcript__ concerning pH and Resistance:

#### **Rule:** The urine specimen is only good for about an hour. After an hour the tests lose their real meaning because the bacteria in the specimen change it.

#### **Rule:** Calcium is needed more by weight and volume than any other mineral.

#### Merry Christmas everyone. Today I decided to extract another __Rule from the Owens transcript__ that provides a compelling reason to consider modalities that address emotions to augment RBTI.

#### "__Emotions.__ If there are plenty, or almost enough of calciums, then any loss of energy shown by an increase in the total undigested protein can be caused by emotional causes:
##### a. hate,
##### b. revenge,
##### c. worry, or
##### d. not living the golden rule.

#### In other words, emotional things can be the beginning of your liver not accepting enough calciums which may be the beginning of ulcers, which again is the liver not accepting enough calciums.

#### That may appear to be a contradiction but the result is a mineral deficiency which is the cause of all diseases and there's no exception to that rule, but your mental attitude can be one of the causes as to why the mineral deficiency exists, and this will show up at the earliest stage in all of the numbers as a loss of energy."

#### Reviewing Bach Flowers, Emotion Code, Affirmations, etc may be something you want to review in order to offer your RBTI clientele a more robust experience and possibly collapse balancing timelines.
