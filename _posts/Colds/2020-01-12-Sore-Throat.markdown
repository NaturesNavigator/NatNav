###  First Try Lemon, Ginger, and Honey in Water

#### An age-old home remedy for treating sore throat is a mixture of lemon juice, ginger, and honey mixed with water. This therapy works typically for two reasons. The ginger helps loosen mucus from the respiratory system, while honey and lemon soothe the throat.

#### You will need:

    * 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger
    * 1 teaspoon honey
    * ½ squeezed lemon
    * ½ cup hot water

#### Mix 1 teaspoon of powdered ginger and 1 teaspoon honey well in ½ cup water and add ½ squeezed lemon juice into the mixture. Drink this mixture for instant pain relief.

### Next Suck on Garlic

#### If you have garlic in your kitchen, you may be in luck. Since time immemorial, garlic has been revered for its antibacterial properties. In addition, garlic is used widely in homeopathic treatments.

#### You will need:

	* 1 fresh clove of garlic, diced in half

#### Simply place one piece of raw garlic in each cheek, and suck on it as you would do with cough drops. If you can chew it; good for you! But if you can't, then just crush it against the teeth which will result in the release of allicin. Do this once a day to combat germ-causing pain, which in turn, will make your sore throat feel better.

### Next Gargle with Salt Water

#### Saying goodbye to a sore throat is quite easy with a little gargling. All you need to try is an old-fashioned home remedy of gargling with salt water. The reason why your throat turns sore is that the cells of mucous membrane become inflamed. Salt is one ingredient that helps pull out moisture from the inflamed tissues and makes your throat less susceptible to bacteria.

#### You will need:

	* 1 cup of warm water (8 oz.)
	* ½ teaspoon of salt

#### Heat one cup of water for about 30 seconds (should be warm, not hot). Add and thoroughly mix ½ teaspoon of table salt in the water. After dissolving the mixture, gargle for 5-7 minutes, and repeat this twice or thrice a day as required.

### Next Make and Enjoy Baking Soda Tea

#### As baking soda makes the throat alkaline, there is no chance for bacteria to thrive. Because of this reason, baking soda is touted as an excellent and effective home remedy for a sore throat. Baking soda has many uses, so it’s always a good idea to keep a box on hand in your cupboard or pantry.

#### You will need:

	* 1 cup water (warm, not hot)
	* ½ teaspoon of baking soda
	* ½ teaspoon salt

#### Heat 1 cup water so that it is warm but not boiling. Then, add a ½ teaspoon salt and a pinch of baking soda to it. Gargle and spit the mixture. Repeat this thrice a day.

### Next Drink or Gargle with Sage Tea

#### Sage has been used medicinally for centuries. It is an astringent herb that causes contraction of the tissues that relieves swelling. This is the reason why sage tea will ease swelling and relieve a sore throat.

#### You will need:

	* 1 cup of boiling water
	* Little bit honey (only if you prefer sweet tea)
	* 2 teaspoons sage leaves
	* ¼ ounce salt (if not adding honey)

#### In 1 cup boiling water, put two teaspoons sage leaves and let them steep for 10-15 minutes. After that, strain out the leaves and drink the mixture. If you like sweet tea, just put a little bit honey in it.

#### Next Steam It Out

#### Steam is a great solution for easing the soreness in your throat, especially when you aren't able to breathe properly due to congestion.

#### You will need:

	* 1 big bowl
	* 1 large bath towel
	* boiling water to fill the bowl halfway

#### All you need to do is add boiling water in a large bowl and lean over the bowl with your head covered with a towel. To make the entire steaming session more relaxing, you can even add a little amount of Eucalyptus oil.

### Next Chomp the Cloves

#### Perhaps you have heard about cloves that cloves can be a powerful remedy for toothaches and throat pain. They contain eugenol, which is a natural anesthetic and an effective painkiller. So, once you chew on a clove, it will release eugenol that will numb the throat pain. Just suck on the clove until it becomes soft and chew it like chewing gum.

#### You will need:

	* a few cloves
	* a cup of water (optional)

### Next Try Apple Cider Vinegar

#### As germs can't survive in an acidic environment, apple cider vinegar makes an amazing home remedy for treating sore throat. Its high acidity level soothes a sore throat and combats infection. When mixed with honey, this solution is even more effective.

#### You will need:

	* 1 teaspoon of apple cider vinegar
	* 1 teaspoon of honey
	* 1 teaspoon of lemon juice (optional)
	* 1 cup of warm water

#### Mix apple cider vinegar, honey, and lemon in a cup of warm water. While the mixture is still warm, drink it for relief.

### Next Prepare Chamomile Tea

#### A natural remedy for treating sore throat is chamomile tea. For a sound sleep, you should drink a cup of chamomile tea because it features properties that go to work as natural pain-killing agents. This herb not only soothes the throat; it also helps you relax.

#### You will need:

	* 1 sachet of chamomile tea
	* 1 cup of boiling water
	* an empty mug

#### Once the water is boiled, transfer it into an empty mug and put the chamomile tea bag in it. Let the tea steep inside and drink this beverage for fast relief.

### Next Hot Toddy

#### A shot of hot toddy can kick a sore throat right in the painful tissue. It warms the chest and helps you get some sound sleep. This, of course, is a remedy for adults.

#### You will need:

	* 1 ounce of whiskey
	* 1 tablespoon of honey
	* 1 tablespoon of lemon juice
	* hot water

#### Add whiskey, honey, and lemon juice in a cup of hot water. Properly stir the mixture and drink it before bedtime.
