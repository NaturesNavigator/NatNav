#### I wanted to share an experience I had a few weeks back during my studies. I experienced that my eyes felt very stressed and dry.  From my studies and prior experiences with natural remedies I thought to try using Castor Oil as a resolution. I knew I could use it in the eye and wanted to experiment to see the best way to incorporate this into my daily routine.

#### My theory was that the oil applied on my eyelids at night before bed would dissolve into my eyelids and perhaps make them more pliable and work more effectively.  I did know that using this in my eyes was safe if you followed a simple rule.  The rule was to use hexane-free castor oil and if it was organic that would be a big plus.

#### Now a day it is used in a variety of products from shampoo, makeup, the manufacturing of plastics, as well as a food additive. While this oil has a variety of uses, what most people don’t realize is that this wonder oil can also treat dry eyes. If you’re looking for a natural way to treat dry eyes, look no further than castor oil eye drops.

### Causes of Dry Eyes

#### Dry eyes can occur due to many different reasons. From contact lenses to old age or even trauma of the tear production system can cause dry, burning, and/or itchy eyes. Even the environment plays a role in causing dry eyes, especially in places with low humidity or high pollen count.

#### The eye is naturally lubricated every time that you blink. The tear production of your eyes is constantly working to ensure that your eyes stay nice and moist. However, dry eye occurs when either the tear production is not working or you’re not blinking as often as you need to. This is why people who stare at a computer, tv, or even book for a prolonged period of time experience this condition. The intense focus on one object inhibits how often we blink.

#### Having dry eyes can lead to a variety of serious eye conditions such as keratoconjunctivitis sicca or KCS. Basically, this eye condition causes exaggerated symptoms of normal dry eye with the addition of light sensitivity and watery eyes. If this condition is left untreated, it can lead to permanent eye damage.

### Benefits of Castor Oil Eye Drops

#### While some commercial eye drops include castor oil, many people have found that using pure castor oil works better when relieving dry eyes. Just one to two drops of 100% castor oil in each eye administered by a clean dropper will do the trick. Apply this treatment 1 to 3 times a day. Castor oil moisturizes the eye while reducing any and all inflammation around the eyes. If you have swollen eyes caused by allergies, you can also use this oil as well.

#### Simply dip your finger into the oil and gently rub it around your eyelids where most of the swelling is. The oil will reduce the swelling as well as relieve any redness due to irritation.

#### While there is no scientific evidence that castor oil will cure any kind of eye condition, it has shown to relieve the symptoms of dry eye. When choosing your castor oil, make sure to purchase oil that is organic, was never sprayed with pesticides and/or was never treated chemically. Both the pesticides and chemicals can actually destroy the beneficial nutrients of castor oil while contaminating it.

#### Using castor oil eye drops is just one way that this oil is proving to be even more of a beneficial cure. The antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and even immune stimulant properties of castor oil are continually being proven as scientists are conducting more and more studies on the effects of castor oil.
